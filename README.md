# The-Great-Color-Guessing-Game-by-Shaily-Jain
This project is written in Java with JavaFX using JDK8 in IntelliJ IDEA. 

We know that we can form each and every color by mixing red, green and blue color in some proportion. This game tests your RGB skills. It gives you a RGB color along with six different colored rectangles, out of which one of the rectangle is of the same color as the given RGB  color. Your task is to pick the target rectangle. If you select the correct rectangle then a set of new rectangles will come but if you select incorrect rectangle then that rectangle will fade away leaving behind rest of the rectangle.

The main motive behing this game is to improve your RGB skills with fun.
